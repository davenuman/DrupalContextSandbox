DrupalContextSandbox
====================

This is an initial sandbox for playing with a DrupalContext for Behat.
This is less of a functional project, and more for experimentation and
illustrating concepts during a discovery phase.

To run this sandbox:

1) Get composer

```sh
curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
```

2) Download the dependencies

```sh
php composer.phar install
```

3) Run the tests!

```sh
./bin/behat
```
